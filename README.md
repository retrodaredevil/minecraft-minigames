# Minecraft Minigames - Josh's Server Code
This is a Spigot Minecraft plugin designed to run on Josh's server. It's not designed to be configurable for
others to use.

### Code duplication
You might notice that there is very similar code from game to game. Some of this code duplication could be solved by
using common base classes or interfaces. However, for speed of development and so that no bad abstractions are
created, I have opted many times for code duplication rather than reuse. In the future this may change, but I believe
that the choices I'm making now are good to avoid needless complexity down the line.
